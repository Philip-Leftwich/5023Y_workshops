# Code exercises for Group workshop 1
You may want a copy of this weeks worksheet to hand to help you. Each exercise has some code hints, try not to use this before trying to solve the problems as a group. When prompted jot down the answers you have submitted as these will be part of the quiz hosted on Blackboard. These quizzes are vital for me to track how everyone is getting on, and to indicate areas of the course that we may need to revisit. 

## Section 1 - Working with a matrix

R’s base data structures can be organised by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). We have already been working with 1d structures `vectors`:

```{r logicals2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(rbind(
                    c("1d","Vector", "List"),
                    c("2d", "Matrix", "Data Frame")),
              caption = 'Basic Data Structures',
              col.names = c("", "Homeogenous", "Heterogenous"),
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

### Exercise 1

We are going to move into a new dimension (oooo!) as we consider data in a matrix. 

First copy this into your terminal and assign it as a vector we will call `x`

55.3846, 51.5385, 46.1538, 42.8205, 40.7692, 38.7179, 35.641, 33.0769, 28.9744, 26.1538, 23.0769, 22.3077, 22.3077, 23.3333, 25.8974, 29.4872, 32.8205, 35.3846, 40.2564, 44.1026, 46.6667, 50, 53.0769, 56.6667, 59.2308, 61.2821, 61.5385, 61.7949, 57.4359, 54.8718, 52.5641, 48.2051, 49.4872, 51.0256, 45.3846, 42.8205, 38.7179, 35.1282, 32.5641, 30, 33.5897, 36.6667, 38.2051, 29.7436, 29.7436, 30, 32.0513, 35.8974, 41.0256, 44.1026, 47.1795, 49.4872, 51.5385, 53.5897, 55.1282, 56.6667, 59.2308, 62.3077, 64.8718, 67.9487, 70.5128, 71.5385, 71.5385, 69.4872, 46.9231, 48.2051, 50, 53.0769, 55.3846, 56.6667, 56.1538, 53.8462, 51.2821, 50, 47.9487, 29.7436, 29.7436, 31.2821, 57.9487, 61.7949, 64.8718, 68.4615, 70.7692, 72.0513, 73.8462, 75.1282, 76.6667, 77.6923, 79.7436, 81.7949, 83.3333, 85.1282, 86.4103, 87.9487, 89.4872, 93.3333, 95.3846, 98.2051, 56.6667, 59.2308, 60.7692, 63.0769, 64.1026, 64.359, 74.359, 71.2821, 67.9487, 65.8974, 63.0769, 61.2821, 58.7179, 55.1282, 52.3077, 49.7436, 47.4359, 44.8718, 48.7179, 51.2821, 54.1026, 56.1538, 52.0513, 48.7179, 47.1795, 46.1538, 50.5128, 53.8462, 57.4359, 60, 64.1026, 66.9231, 71.2821, 74.359, 78.2051, 67.9487, 68.4615, 68.2051, 37.6923, 39.4872, 91.2821, 50, 47.9487, 44.1026


Then copy this into your terminal and assign it as vector `y`

97.1795, 96.0256, 94.4872, 91.4103, 88.3333, 84.8718, 79.8718, 77.5641, 74.4872, 71.4103, 66.4103, 61.7949, 57.1795, 52.9487, 51.0256, 51.0256, 51.0256, 51.4103, 51.4103, 52.9487, 54.1026, 55.2564, 55.641, 56.0256, 57.9487, 62.1795, 66.4103, 69.1026, 55.2564, 49.8718, 46.0256, 38.3333, 42.1795, 44.1026, 36.4103, 32.5641, 31.4103, 30.2564, 32.1795, 36.7949, 41.4103, 45.641, 49.1026, 36.0256, 32.1795, 29.1026, 26.7949, 25.2564, 25.2564, 25.641, 28.718, 31.4103, 34.8718, 37.5641, 40.641, 42.1795, 44.4872, 46.0256, 46.7949, 47.9487, 53.718, 60.641, 64.4872, 69.4872, 79.8718, 84.1026, 85.2564, 85.2564, 86.0256, 86.0256, 82.9487, 80.641, 78.718, 78.718, 77.5641, 59.8718, 62.1795, 62.5641, 99.4872, 99.1026, 97.5641, 94.1026, 91.0256, 86.4103, 83.3333, 79.1026, 75.2564, 71.4103, 66.7949, 60.2564, 55.2564, 51.4103, 47.5641, 46.0256, 42.5641, 39.8718, 36.7949, 33.718, 40.641, 38.3333, 33.718, 29.1026, 25.2564, 24.1026, 22.9487, 22.9487, 22.1795, 20.2564, 19.1026, 19.1026, 18.3333, 18.3333, 18.3333, 17.5641, 16.0256, 13.718, 14.8718, 14.8718, 14.8718, 14.1026, 12.5641, 11.0256, 9.8718, 6.0256, 9.4872, 10.2564, 10.2564, 10.641, 10.641, 10.641, 10.641, 10.641, 10.641, 8.718, 5.2564, 2.9487, 25.7692, 25.3846, 41.5385, 95.7692, 95, 92.6923

```{r vector, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r vector-hint-1}
x <- 
```

```{r vector-hint-2}
x <- c( ,  ,  , ...)
```

```{r vector-hint-3}
x <- c( , , , ...)
y <- c( , , , ...)
x
y
```

When you have assigned elements to vectors x and y we will combine them to create a matrix called workshop_dataset, and use the function `head` to check the first 10 rows and that everything looks ok

```{r echo=TRUE}
workshop_dataset <- matrix(c(x,y),ncol=2)
head(workshop_dataset)
```

### Exercise 2
Think back to how you could pull an element from a vector by it's position, we will try this again but for a matrix this time. What value is in the 2nd column of the 37th row of our matrix?
```{r matrix, exercise=TRUE}
workshop_dataset[ , ]
```

```{r matrix-hint-1}
workshop_dataset[37, ]
```

```{r matrix-solution}
workshop_dataset[37,2]
```

```{r matrix-check}
grade_code ("You rock!")
```


### Exercise 3
Alright enough dry number crunching, let's make our first plot in R. Can you use the function `plot` to make a very simple scatter plot of our matrix?
```{r plot, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r plot-hint-1}
plot()
```


```{r plot-solution}
plot (workshop_dataset)
```


```{r plot-check}
grade_code(
  correct = "ROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRR",
  incorrect = "If you put plot(x,y) then you will have got the right figure, but I was expecting you to call the matrix with plot(workshop_dataset)",)
```



## Section 2 - working with a pre-existing dataset
### Here is the Palmer Penguins dataset

```{r penguin data}
penguins
```

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("winr_01_files/figure-html/penguins.png")
```


### Exercise 4

Create a ggplot2 graph of penguin mass vs. flipper length. 
```{r penguin-plot, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r penguin-plot-hint-1}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x =  , y =  )) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r penguin-plot-check}
grade_code ("Good job!")

```

```{r penguin-plot-hint-2}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y =  )) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r penguin-plot-solution}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Questions

### Creating a multiple choice question

```{r q1}
question("What is the best animal?",
         answer("Pika", message = "So close."),
         answer("Shark", message = "Also very cool."),
         answer("Lobster", message = "You did it!", correct = TRUE),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
